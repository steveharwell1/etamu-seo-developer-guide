# News Article Writing
## SEO/UX/Accessibility Guide
Best practices for ensuring news stories and articles are optimized for search engines and user experience, thereby improving visibility, engagement and overall performance.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
### Exact Keyword Match
- Use Yoast’s Focus Keyphrase field to research potential keywords.
- Ensure the focus keyphrase is included naturally within the content. Keywords can be used in the headline, subheadings and throughout the body copy.
- Avoid keyword stuffing.

### Slug/URL
Create a clean, concise URL that includes the exact focus keyphrase, avoiding unnecessary words and keeping it simple for readability.
:::note
WordPress generates the slug/url based on the headline, however, these do not have to be the same.

### Headline
Craft a compelling headline that encourages readers to click through to read the article.

You may include the focus keyphrase in the headline, but it is not necessary for SEO purposes.

### Subheadings
- Use at least two subheadings (H3) to break up content for readability and organization. 
- Incorporate the focus keyphrase or variations when possible.

### First 200 Words
- Introduce the topic clearly within the first 200 words.
- Ensure the focus keyphrase is included and the content is engaging to hook the reader into continuing through the article.

### Meta Description
- Write a concise description including the exact focus keyphrase or variations.
- The description should be between 100-150 characters
- End with a call to action such as “Read more” or “Learn more.”

### Alt Text for Images
Add descriptive alternative text for all images. Include the focus keyphrase if relevant to improve image SEO and accessibility. The alt text should describe the image with enough detail for a vision-impaired person to understand the image content similarly to someone looking at the image.

Also consider that a screen reader will vocalize the alt text, followed by the image caption.

### Internal Links
- If relevant, place a call to action (CTA) near the beginning of the article, otherwise, use inline links within the content.
  - Click-throughs and reading through the whole article are both engagement metrics.
- Include at least two internal links to relevant pages on the external/marketing website.
- Do not use “Open in New Tab” for inline links, as users are accustomed to opening in a new link if desired.

### External Links
- Include at least two external links to relevant, authoritative sources that add credibility to the content.
- Do not use “Open in New Tab” for inline links, as users are accustomed to opening in a new link if desired.

### Related People
- Ensure that ETAMU people within the article are listed in the “Related People” field.
- You may also link to their profile page with inline links within the content.

### Body Length
Ensure that the body of the article is at least 150 words. Longer content tends to perform better, so aim for a more comprehensive length.

### Featured Image
- Choose a high-quality featured image that is relevant to the content. The image should be visually appealing and as close to a **16:9 ratio** as possible. Try not to use the Preview Image field.
- Do not use the “Inside of Post” option in the Featured Image Position field for vertical images.

### Yoast Social Preview
Check Yoast’s Social Preview section to ensure the text and image align correctly when shared on social media.
- If the text and image appear side by side, the image is too vertical.
- You may choose to create a separate preview image in Photoshop.

## User Experience
### Hyperlinks
Do not use “Open in New Tab” for inline links, as users are accustomed to opening in a new link if desired.
- Mobile users may become annoyed with multiple windows popping up.

### Subheadings
- Subheadings should be brief thoughts that allude to the content that the subheading is introducing.
- Use sentence-case capitalization
- No punctuation other than question marks
- Format in H3 style

## Accessibility
