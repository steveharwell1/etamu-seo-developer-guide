## Key Enhancements by TAMUC web team
The following updates bring increased usability, enhanced customization, and optimized performance to improve both user and contributor experiences.

Menu and breadcrumb displays will continue to exclude text before a colon (:) in page titles.

SEO Optimization with Yoast: Update your publishing processes! Because of this change, it is now important to customize the page title with Yoast for optimal SEO.

### YouTube Playlist Block
- **The YouTube playlist block has been updated to automatically play the first video listed in the block.** It then plays the rest of the videos in the playlist in the order they are arranged on YouTube, not the order they are arranged on WordPress
- **A “Prevent autoplay” checkbox is now present.** Activating it will unmute the video and not autoplay the playlist.
- **The blank video function has been removed due to changes in YouTube’s API functionality, simplifying the playlist experience.** This update was already pushed back in September.
### Edit and View Links on Multi-Selects Updated
- **Marcomm Editors** see “Edit” and are taken directly to the edit page.
- **Contributors** will see “New Revision" instead of "Edit".
- This removes a backdoor where contributors could make edits to pages.
### Improved Emergency Alerts Placement
Emergency Alerts have been relocated to the left side of the interface for improved user visibility.
### Enhanced Mobile Footer Usability
Footer Padding: Footer items now feature padding to ensure all tap targets meet accessibility standards (minimum 24x24px) on mobile devices.
### WP 6.6 Compatibility Checks
Revisionary Plugin Verification: Confirmed that the Revisionary plugin functions as expected with WordPress 6.6, maintaining a smooth revision experience for contributors.
### CSS Migration Verification
Customizer CSS: Confirmed successful migration of customizer CSS, retaining custom styling after the update.
### Optimized Script Loading
Script Efficiency: Non-essential scripts are now loaded conditionally. frontend.js and carouselSections.js only load on relevant pages, enhancing page load performance.
### Link to submit feedback is customized
When someone clicks the feedback link the URL of the page they are on will be passed to the form. Also, if they are logged in their email address will be passed to the form.
### Stat facts css update
Accessibility improvements have been made to the style and structure of the stats facts template.
### Other interface updates
Question series block now ignores missing fields like the background image field.
